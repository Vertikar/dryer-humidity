Simple sketch to talk to a DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor
and output the values on serial
(Also with LED for status output)

Connect the DHT11 sensor like this:

(Looking at package with holes on top, connectors on left)
1st connection +ve (3 or 5v)
2nd connection +dte (Data)
3rd blank
4th connection -ve

Connect the data to analogue input 0

LED is a common anode RGB, so common (longest leg)
goes to +ve
Each other leg via a resistor to digital pins 5,6,7
